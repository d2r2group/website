    "section": "Renewable Energy Materials",
    "text": "Renewable Energy Materials\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenewable energy solutions are crucial to combat the challenges that come with climate change – a cause we feel passionate about. Converting heat to electricity is a promising avenue towards reducing the waste of energy and the subsequent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions – a prime goal of environmental groups and Green activists in recent decades. Thermionic energy conversion (TEC) is a process in which heat gets converted into electricity by thermionic emission of electrons from a heated electrode (cathode) that are collected at a cooler electrode (anode). The resulting potential difference creates a usable electric output current. We have been focusing in discovering new materials and approaches to enable thermionic conversion with high efficiency. An illustration of a thermionic converter and its band diagram is shown on the left. The conversion efficiency strongly increases with increasing cathode temperature and decreasing barrier index. To make this process efficient even at lower temperatures, a material is required that easily emits electrons from its surface. The property that determines how much energy is required to extract an electron is called the work function. Lower work functions facilitate the emission of electrons at lower temperatures. Reducing the work function reduces the barrier index (see above Figure) and hence, strongly increases the efficiency curve. We have developed a new approach to achieve a record-low work function (0.7 eV) for the anode of a TEC. This was ~0.3 eV lower than the lowest experimentally verified work function to date. The anode is comprised of a semiconductor (Gallium Arsenide) with an alkaline monolayer coating which creates surface dipoles that reduce the work function. Further reduction of the work function is achieved by shining a laser onto the semiconductor that induces an additional shift in the energy structure of the material. We applied this new concept to the anode of an experimental converter to demonstrate its feasibility for future high-efficiency energy conversion applications."

    "text": "Material Surfaces with Tuned Properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolid-state surface properties are of utmost importance for many applications including catalysis, chemical synthesis, crystal growth, energy conversion, and electrochemistry. Most of our research projects rely on tuning surface properties and involve a thorough study of the surface chemistry and electronic properties at the surface. Surface termination and functional surface groups are key enablers for the growth of high quality growth of thin films. Another key surface property for the efficient conversion of heat into electricity is the work function. This electronic property determines how much energy is required to extract and electron from the surface of a materials. Tuning surface properties play a key role in a few other projects that we and our collaborators worked on. Understanding of the precursor – substrate surface interaction is crucial when it comes to studying the nucleation phase of film growth during atomic layer deposition (ALD). Nucleation is strongly controlled by the surface termination and interfacial interaction between the precursor and the substrate. This limits the minimum thickness for films requiring complete coverage for many ALD chemistries. In Nature Catalysis (see illustration on the left) we report a new technique that uses carbon monoxide as a passivation gas during ALD to modify the surface energy of already deposited Pt nanoparticles to assist direct deposition onto a carbon catalyst support. This new approach to synthesizing nanoparticulate Pt/C catalysts achieved high Pt mass activities for the oxygen reduction reaction. The growth of Pt using conventional ALD and passivation-gas-incorporated ALD is illustrated below on the left and right, respectively. In another project, we have developed an ab-initio photoemission model that accurately describes the photoemission process for the most diverse range of photocathode materials to date. Our model directly includes the full electronic structure of the material, photoexcitation probabilities for all direct optical transitions, and an improved surface-vacuum barrier transmission probability. For materials with a short skin-depth (typically metals) it is important to include electronic surface states in the photoemission model to accurately predict the emittance."

    "section": "Thin-film Synthesis at the Atomic Scale",
    "text": "Thin-film Synthesis at the Atomic Scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey pieces of modern day electronic device technology keep following the trend of down-scaling. Thin film deposition has become of great importance in the semiconductor industry as critical device dimensions have reached the nanometer scale. As down-scaling continues rapidly, device features approach fundamental physical limits. During Prof. Peter’s doctoral research (at the University of Vienna and Stanford University) his work’s focus was on the characterization of thin films for new high-efficiency applications in solar cells and next-generation dielectrics. The experimental work was particularly focused on atomic layer deposition (ALD), which is a key enabling technique to synthesize high-quality thin films with precise thickness control down to the Angstrom level while staying at low processing temperatures. Unlike in conventional chemical vapor deposition techniques (where there is a continuous flow of precursor gas) in ALD the precursors are introduced sequentially until saturation of the precursor reaction with the surface has occurred and the by-products and remaining precursors are purged out. The key feature that enables this high-quality, conformal growth is the self-limiting nature of the individual half-steps, as illustrated below for the growth of aluminum oxide with the tri-methyl-aluminum (TMA) precursor. Due to the cycle-based nature of this deposition technique thin films can be grown with thickness control down to the atomic level. During plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) a more reactive plasma is used as an oxidant which facilitates lower processing temperatures and higher film quality. However, PEALD typically exhibits less conformal growth of films deposited on complex 3-dimensional substrates with high aspect ratios. We have established processes to deposit thin dielectric films with a record-breaking high dielectric constant and high conformality on complex, high aspect-ratio substrates using PEALD. These metrics are crucial for dynamic RAM applications and resulted in multiple publications and patents with our industrial collaborators. Our ALD-related work is relevant for applications in dielectrics, solar cells, low etching-rate spacer materials, sensors, and catalysis."

During this time, I worked as a research assistant at an institute near my university and in parallel as a teaching assistant. Discovering that the combination of research and teaching is my passion, I made the decision to begin the path to becoming a professor.

    "text": "Ground rules\n\nWe judge each other based on our character and behavior and treat each other with respect.\nThis group’s hierarchy is very flat (which is more common in the US than some other countries). Our respect for one another, does not depend on our professional qualifications and we stand on equal footing.\nResearch and academia is about critical thinking. In our day-to-day work we have to criticize and question each other constantly - however, this is purely related to research and does not relate to any personal qualities. Criticism is always to be stated and assumed to be in good faith. Especially in written communication, criticism can sound more personal than it was actually meant. Always assume written communication was meant in good faith. Personal attacks are not tolerated.\n“I don’t know” is a perfectly reasonable answer. Academia is about integrity and learning, it’s not about knowing everything.\nWe welcome people from all backgrounds, races, genders, religions, and cultures. We all have biases and as a lab with many international people we all have different cultural backgrounds. However, we aim to tackle the biases we (unconsciously) hold and help each other to understand each other’s viewpoints and point us to our own blind spots.\nMistakes happen and conflict can arise. Always try to address these issues shortly after they arose in a 1-on-1 conversation (ideally in person). Don’t ignore issues and let them bottle up or act in a passive aggressive way. If the 1-on-1 meeting did not solve the issue, involve me in the meeting and I can try to mediate. If I am the person who you have an issue with, also talk to me 1-on-1 first. If that does not resolve the issue, reach out to the Department chair or any relevant advisor at Northeastern.\nIn general, I am always happy to meet with anyone from the group (regardless if active or past member) to give life advice and try my best to help you succeed and overcome life challenges. You can share everything in confidence with me - however, be aware that I am obligated to report certain information if that information falls under Title IX."

    "section": "My General Expectations",
    "text": "My General Expectations\nThe following points do not apply for co-advised students as their work agreement is with their main advisor, not with me.\n\nI am giving you freedom on how/when to work. You have to figure out what works best for you and which way you are most productive (e.g. I am quite productive at night - but that doesn’t mean you need to reply to my emails at midnight). I won’t be micro-managing you.\nThe main thing I expect of you is scientific curiosity, that you are driven to learn something new, and grow as a person/professional.\nAcademia is about endurance and learning. So, try to not burn yourself out - research is more like a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on working smart rather than hard. Take breaks when you need them! Our work involves a lot of creativity and focus - it’s hard to be truly creative when stressed.\nThe number of hours spent on research depend on your position/employment and our arrangement. Details are discussed in the next section. Typically, I don’t expect you to work on weekends and holidays and I avoid having meetings scheduled outside of 9 am - 5 pm EST. In rare circumstances (e.g. close to some deadline or due to time zone shifts) there may be an exception to this but should generally not be expected. However, from my own experience as a Ph.D. student, I know there are phases (e.g. exams week) where things can get crazy. I aim to support you during those times as much as I can.\nPhysical and mental health goes first. If you need a day off for these reasons, that is perfectly fine with me and does not count as vacation days.\nDiscuss longer leaves of absence and vacation ahead of time with me. This is mainly for planning purposes.\nWe typically take time off during winter break (at the very least no meetings) and about 2 weeks during the summer (some meetings might be virtual when I am traveling)."

For that I will help you with career advice, resume/CV critique, connect you to opportunities in academia, industry, and start-ups. Having spent time in both academia and start-ups working with industrial partners gives me a wide perspective and I’m able to advise you on various career trajectories.\nAdvice and training in various soft skills and skills relevant in academia and industry, such as presentation skills, scientific writing, software engineering, coding, networking, etc.\nRecommendation letter: If we work together for at least 10 hours a week for 1 semester, then I can typically judge your performance enough to be able to write you a recommendation letter. Your input and progress during our time working together determines the strength of that letter. Please, inform me a few weeks ahead of time and share with me your updated CV, job posting, and relevant talking points that help me to write the letter."

For longer issues (and administrative issues that involve MIE/NEU staff) email is preferable. For very urgent matters you can text my cell, but I typically receive Teams notifications on my phone anyway.\nIdeally, reply to my messages on the same day or the next.

You have skills I don’t have and I have skills that you don’t have. I will still advise you on the general direction of our projects together and also help you plan for your next career steps.\nYou will be expected to advise graduate and undergraduate students in our group and help them getting up to speed with various computational topics.\nYou will have opportunities to support me during teaching (especially critical if you want to pursue an academic career).\nOverall I give you a lot of freedom in pursuing your research interests (especially if you have your own funding/scholarship). However, I do expect some contribution to the group’s code base and development of computational workflows that benefit the entire group’s research activities. If you are hired for a specific externally funded project, then you are of course in charge of it.\n\nPh.D. Student/Candidate\n\nThe Ph.D. is a marathon and I am here to support you along the way.\nI closely advise you on research and career development. In the beginning I will tell you what to focus on and in our discussions I will mostly know the answers to problems. As you progress during your Ph.D. my involvement as an advisor steadily decreases and by the end of it you will know the answers and I won’t. That evolution will be exciting to see unfold!\nResearch and fulfilling your course credits will be a full-time job. Typically, during the summer you can focus entirely on research.\nThe courses you pick ideally complement the research that you do for your thesis (while also covering all core materials science courses).\nI generally advise doing an internship towards the later stages of your PhD (end of 3rd year) and I will help you with the search. Ideally, that internship complements your research expertise (while enhancing it).\n\nMaster’s and Undergraduate Students\n\nThe project we work on together is usually clearly defined and the scope and effort per week for a certain duration is agreed upon in our initial meeting.\nA reasonable research project usually is a commitment of at least 10 hours/week for at least 1 semester. This is also the typical minimum to justify a recommendation letter (depending on your performance). Two semesters is typically better to finalize meaningful work and potentially publish the results.\nI advise the necessary steps during most of the project but I am happy to see self-guided initiative as well.\nI support you and provide you guidance on next career steps."
