## Presentations

Prof. Peter gave a seminar at the Experiential AI (EAI) Institute at Northeastern University. Further information such
as abstract, slides, and the recording is available [here](https://ai.northeastern.edu/ai-events/how-ai-is-revolutionizing-the-discovery-of-materials/).
Also, the recording is embedded below:
