## Interactive DFT Tutorial

Both ASE and GPAW operate through Python. We will be using Google’s Colab service to make it easy to follow along.
No need to install Python locally - you only need a browser. Our code will be running in a Jupyter notebook
using Google’s resources.<br>

To access a Python notebook just follow
[this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uaHuh2K8wn6XjVm-aAYB30-G98NpNcH5?usp=sharing) and then
click on ‘File’ > ‘Save a copy in Drive…’.<br>

Once you have copied the notebook to your Google Drive you can edit, execute and work on it.
