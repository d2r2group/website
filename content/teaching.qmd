## Philosophy

> *Those who know, do. Those that understand, teach.* <br>
> --- Aristotle

Teaching is a key mission of every academic institution and I feel very passionately about sharing my expertise with
the next generation of students and researchers. Sharing the diverse topics I learned as a researcher is a very
fulfilling opportunity that enables me to give back to the academic community. My teaching style was inspired by
the very passionate teachers I was fortunate to have had during my undergraduate years at the University of Vienna,
during which I absorbed the fundamentals of Physics and Mathematics.

**Materials Informatics**<br>
Originally taught as a demonstration lecture at Northeastern University.<br>
This interactive Python tutorial is designed to teach advanced materials and crystallography concepts using the pymatgen package in Python.
It further lays out the basics of requesting materials data using the Materials Project API.<br>
*Presentation slides/recording upon request.*<br>

**Density Functional Theory with ASE and GPAW**<br>
Originally taught as a guest lecture at Stanford University in course *ME420 Advanced Electrochemistry*.<br>
I conceptualized and taught an interactive tutorial on how to use Density Functional Theory (DFT) facilitated by easy
to follow Python code. The interactive, hands-on tutorial enables student to run basic DFT calculations
without needing to install any software on their computer.<br>
