Whereas past efforts aimed at discovering photocathode materials have typically employed trial-and-error-based iterative approaches, this work represents the first data-driven screening for high brightness photocathode materials. Through screening over 74 000 semiconducting materials, a vast photocathode dataset is generated, resulting in statistically meaningful insights into the nature of high brightness photocathode materials. This screening results in a diverse list of photocathode materials that exhibit intrinsic emittances that are up to 4x lower than currently used photocathodes. In a second effort, multiobjective screening is employed to identify the family of M2O (M = Na, K, Rb) that exhibits photoemission properties that are comparable to the current state-of-the-art photocathode materials, but with superior air stability.

Compared to previous photoemission models, this is accomplished by considerably reducing the number of approximations and assumptions used in representing the photoemission process and the photoemitting material itself. Notably, our model directly includes the full electronic structure of the material, photoexcitation probabilities for all direct optical transitions, and an improved surface-vacuum barrier transmission probability. To test the performance of our model, we perform validations with experimental measurements for all photocathode materials studied in this work. Whereas previous models have often qualitatively disagreed with the measured photoemission properties of some materials, our model is found to provide quantitative agreement with experimental measurements for all tested materials. As an example, our method predicts the root-mean-square transverse momentum of electrons emitted from PbTe up to an excess energy of 1.0 eV with a mean absolute error that is âˆ¼5Ã— less than from previously derived expressions. Perhaps more importantly, our model is able to match experimentally observed decreases in intrinsic emittance with increasing photon energyâ€”a feat that current analytical models are unable to achieve.

In this work we present insights into the electronic-geometric structure relationship of varying compositions of Zn(O,S) grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), a local bonding-sensitive spectroscopic tool, with quantum simulations helps link the atomic structure to the unoccupied density of states (DOS) of the films. The infiltration of sulfur into a ZnO matrix results in the formation of S 3pâ€“Zn 4spâ€“O 2p hybridized orbitals in the near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) region of both the O and S K-edges. The extent of sulfur incorporation affects the ionicity of Zn, which in turn alters the bond lengths of Znâ€“O within the structure and its resulting bandgap. Knowing Zn(O,S)'s electronic-geometric structure interplay allows one to predict, tailor, and optimize its buffer layer performance.}, language = {en}, number = {47}, urldate = {2023-03-16}, journal = {Journal of Materials Chemistry C}, author = {Dadlani, Anup L. and Trejo, Orlando and Acharya, Shinjita and Torgersen, Jan and Petousis, Ioannis and Nordlund, Dennis and Sarangi, Ritimukta and Schindler, Peter and Prinz, Fritz B.}, month = nov, year = {2015}, note = {Publisher: The Royal Society of Chemistry}, pages = {12192--12198}, }

However, coverage of high aspect ratio (AR) structures is limited due to the recombination rates of the radical plasma species. We study the limits of conformality in 1:30 AR structures for TiO2 based on tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium (TDMA-Ti) and O2 plasma through variation in plasma exposure and substrate temperature. Extending plasma exposure duration and decreasing substrate temperature within the ALD window both serve to improve the conformality of the deposited film, with coverage {\textgreater}95\% achievable. Additionally, the changes in morphology of the TiO2 were examined with crystallites of anatase and brookite found.}, number = {18}, urldate = {2023-03-16}, journal = {Langmuir}, author = {Schindler, Peter and Logar, Manca and Provine, J and Prinz, Fritz B.}, month = may, year = {2015}, note = {Publisher: American Chemical Society}, pages = {5057--5062}, }

  abstract   = {The work function (WF) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of organic ligand capped Ag nanoparticles (NPs) have been studied experimentally and computationally. Experimental observations reveal a significant increase in WF as the size of ligand-capped Ag NPs increases, a trend contrary to that previously observed for bare Ag NPs. Computational results confirm the effect on the WF from simplified ligand molecules and relate it to charge transfer between the Ag core and surrounding ligands. We also observe a possible coupling between increases in WF and decreases in SPR transition energy, supported by computational results and attributed to the interplay between the 4d and 5s electron states of the system. These results, along with our observations of WF dependence on ligand choice, indicate the ability to strongly engineer the electronic structure of metal NPs through size and ligand control.},
