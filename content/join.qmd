## Undergraduate Projects and Master's Thesis

Undergraduate students from Northeastern University interested in computational chemistry or materials
informatics/machine learning are always welcome to contact me and we can establish undergraduate research projects
or Master's thesis under my supervision.<br>
**Funding opportunities available.** Minimum time commitment: 10 hours/week for ~6 months.

## Co-Ops and Internships

I have strong connections to start-ups in the renewable energy sector and materials informatics and I can help to
connect (under)graduates to Co-Op or internship opportunities. Reach out if that sounds interesting to you.

## Visiting Researchers and Fellows

Visiting researchers and researchers with a fellowship are always welcome to reach out to me to discuss the
opportunity to work on a project together.<br>
*International applicants*: J1 visa processing typically takes 3-6 months.
