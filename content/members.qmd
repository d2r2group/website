Dr. Peter Schindler is leading the Data-Driven Renewables Research (D2R2) group that seeks to discover novel materials
for renewable energy applications using high-throughput, quantum chemistry calculations, and data-driven materials
property predictions. He is a scientific advisory board member (and former senior scientist)
at [Aionics Inc.](https://aionics.io/), a startup that has become a recognized leader in the field of battery informatics,
by co-innovating with battery manufacturers through AI and high-performance computing. During his postdoctoral research
at the University of Vienna and Stanford University, his research established renewable energy materials both
computationally and experimentally, for which he was awarded the Erwin-Schr√∂dinger fellowship by the
Austrian Science Fund (FWF). He received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Vienna working on thin-film
semiconductor synthesis and characterization. His expertise in both experimental synthesis and computational materials
simulations enables him to carry out cutting-edge research at the intersection of the two fields.

::: {.callout-note title="Bio" appearance="minimal" collapse=true}
Currently, he holds the role of a postdoctoral research associate at Northeastern University, specializing in the
Data-Driven Renewable Research group. His core research revolves around conducting high-throughput
Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and the application of machine learning models to tackle quantum mechanics
and materials science challenges. Prior to undertaking this postdoctoral position, he accomplished his PhD at the
University of Virginia, where he specialized in Electrical Engineering and studied charge transport
in materials using quantum mechanics methods. In the earlier stages of his academic journey, during his MSc, he delved
into the enhancement of low-dimensional materials through molecular dynamics investigations.

### Ardavan Mehdizadeh {.unnumbered .unlisted}
<p class="text-primary">Ph.D. Student in Mechanical Engineering</p>
{{< fa graduation-cap >}} B.Sc. in Civil Engineering, 2015 (Sharif University of Technology)

::: {.callout-note title="Bio" appearance="minimal" collapse=true}
Born and raised in Tehran, Iran, I began a journey of scientific exploration; with a B.Sc. in Civil Engineering from
Sharif University of Technology as part of my qualifications, I entered the world of molecular dynamics and the
intricacies of protein interactions.<br>
My research journey took me to various research institutes within and beyond Sharif University. I deeply engaged in
Molecular Dynamics simulations, uncovering the complications of protein-protein and protein-nanoparticle interactions.
I also had the interest to investigate the complexities of protein folding and the prediction of protein
structure and function.<br>
Now, I'm eagerly diving into the exciting world of computational material science, focusing primarily on quantum
chemistry calculations and data-driven approaches, including machine learning methods, for my PhD. This integration of
sciences promises groundbreaking discoveries in machine learning models driven by statistical insights, and I can't
wait to explore it further.
