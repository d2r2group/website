Dr. Peter Schindler is leading the Data-Driven Renewables Research (D2R2) group that seeks to discover novel materials
for renewable energy applications using high-throughput, quantum chemistry calculations, and data-driven materials
property predictions. He is a scientific advisory board member (and former senior scientist)
at [Aionics Inc.](https://aionics.io/), a startup that has become a recognized leader in the field of battery informatics,
by co-innovating with battery manufacturers through AI and high-performance computing. During his postdoctoral research
at the University of Vienna and Stanford University, his research established renewable energy materials both
computationally and experimentally, for which he was awarded the Erwin-Schrödinger fellowship by the
Austrian Science Fund (FWF). He received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Vienna working on thin-film
semiconductor synthesis and characterization. His expertise in both experimental synthesis and computational materials
simulations enables him to carry out cutting-edge research at the intersection of the two fields.

{{< fa graduation-cap >}} B.Sc. in Civil Engineering, 2015 (Sharif University of Technology)

::: {.callout-note title="Bio" appearance="minimal" collapse=true}
Born and raised in Tehran, Iran, Ardavan began his scientific journey with a B.Sc. in Civil Engineering from Sharif
University of Technology, where he explored molecular dynamics and protein interactions. His research led him to
various institutes, where he engaged in molecular dynamics simulations, focusing on protein-protein and
protein-nanoparticle interactions, as well as protein folding and structure prediction.<br>
Currently, Ardavan is pursuing a PhD in computational materials science. His research combines quantum chemistry and
data-driven methods, particularly machine learning, to address complex problems in surface chemistry.
His work centers on surface reconstruction, with the goal of predicting atomic rearrangements on surfaces using
statistical techniques and neural network force fields (NFFs). Ardavan aims to develop a universal NNF capable of
modeling surface reconstructions across a variety of materials. By integrating principles from physics,
materials science, and computer science, he seeks to advance the application of machine learning in surface science.

::: {.callout-note title="Bio" appearance="minimal" collapse=true}
Never meaning to start a scientific career, my journey started with an apprenticeship as a materials tester at
ThyssenKrupp, one of the biggest steel producers in Germany. In my second year, I got used to the work of our
engineers and realized that this is the work I wanted to do in my future career, both research and
project management.<br>
To reach this goal, I studied Material Science with main focus on ceramics and high-temperature materials. During
this time, I worked as a research assistant at an institute near my university and in parallel as a teaching assistant.
Discovering that the combination of research and teaching is my passion, I made the decision to begin the path
to becoming a professor.<br>
After a quick step back in the industry at MTU Aero Engines in Munich for 1 ½ years, I recently started my doctorate
at the Technical University of Munich. Here, I am currently investigating catalytic materials for the Oxygen
Reduction Reaction in PEM-Fuel Cells.
